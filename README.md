# OCMF
This jupyter program is used to illustrate the Ocean Colour Modelling Framework (OCMF) proposed in Sun, Brewin et al. (submitted) for estimating remote sensing reflectance ( 𝑅𝑟𝑠
 ) from chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST).

The OCMF explicitly incorporates the influence of SST on the relationship between phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and size structure, based on our prior work on the ecological component part (Sun et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113415). It assigns chlorophyll-specific inherent optical properties (IOPs) to each phytoplankton size class, assuming distinct optical environments for them. Additionally, it considers the presence of a background of non-algal particles in the ocean.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image.
