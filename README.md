# OCMF (Ocean Colour Modelling Framework)
This program is used to illustrate the Ocean Colour Modelling Framework (OCMF) proposed in Sun, Brewin et al. (under revision) for estimating remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST), building on the classical Case-1 assumption.

It assumes each phytoplankton size group resides in a distinct optical environment, assigning chlorophyll-specific IOPs to each group. These optical properties are influenced both directly by phytoplankton and indirectly by non-algal particles and dissolved substances. The model also incorporates SST, a key factor affecting phytoplankton size composition (Sun et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113415).
